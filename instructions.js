// Assignment
// ----------

// Your assignment is to build a full-stack simple version of Youtube using the public Youtube API at https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
// It doesn't have to look exactly like the actual Youtube, but the picture is provided to give you a general idea of layout. 

// What We're Looking For:

// 1. React (with or without Redux)
// 2. Server Side Rendering
// 3. Database Connection
// 4. Deployment (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

// I. Search Bar
    
//     * Standard search bar to look up a video 

// II. Main Video Section
    
//     * Should be able to play and pause the video
//     * Underneath the video:
//         * Title
//             * Doesn't have to be clickable
//         * Description under title
//         * List the 'Like' and 'Dislike' counts
//             * You don't have to have a functional 'like' button, just list how many likes and dislikes the video received

// III. Comments Section 
    
//     * Render a list of the top comments with the associated users


// IV. Videos List

//     * Render a clickable list of videos with image thumbnails, similar to the related videos section of Youtube
//         * Each small video should have their clickable title next to it
//     * When you click a video, it should appear in the main section as the main video 
//     * The list should update and still show a full list of videos 

// V. Database
    
//     * Save a list of the clicked videos to a database (not the actual video files, just the title names)
